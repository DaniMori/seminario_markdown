	abstract = {Background
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been shown to be associated with depression in older adults but the results are mixed. We summarized and evaluated the association between depression and MetS in people aged 60 years or over.
Methods
Relevant published studies from January 1997 to July 2017 were identified by searching two electronic databases: PubMed/Medline and EMBASE. Observational studies were considered.
Results
Twelve studies were included in the systematic review. Depression seemed to be related with MetS in the majority of the studies (10/12 = 83.3\%). As far as the longitudinal studies are concerned, the onset of depression was related to MetS in 2 out of 3 studies (66.6\%), while a relation between chronicity of depression and MetS was reported (1 study). Regarding cross-sectional studies, 7 out of 9 (77.7\%) concluded that there was a positive association between depression and MetS. Mixed evidence was found among studies concerning the association between depression and the individual components of MetS. Four out of ten studies (40\%) reported that depression was significantly associated with the waist circumference, a component of MetS.
Limitations
There was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies regarding their design. Only studies written in English, from peer-reviewed journals were included.
Conclusions
Depression seemed to be significantly associated with MetS in people aged 60 years or over. Among the components of MetS, abdominal obesity seemed to be associated more strongly and consistently with depression. The direction of the causality and mechanisms underlying the relationship are still largely unknown.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To assess the association between cognitive reserve (CR) and quality of life (QoL), as well as the role of depression, cognitive functioning, and disability in this association.
Methods
Nationally-representative cross-sectional population-based data on 1973 individuals aged ≥50years from the Spanish sample of the Collaborative Research on Ageing in Europe (COURAGE) study were analysed. CR was a composite score ranging from 0 to 25 obtained from the Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire, which is composed of items on training courses, occupation, musical training, languages, reading activities, intellectual games, and level of education of the participants and their parents. QoL, ranging from 0 to 100, was assessed with the WHOQOL-AGE. Multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were performed.
Results
Higher levels of CR were associated with higher QoL, after controlling for potential confounders (Coef. 0.53; 95\% CI=0.36, 0.70). The strongest mediator in this association was disability, which explained about half of the association, while depression and cognition explained 6–10\% of this association.
Discussion
CR is associated with higher QoL in older adults. Interventions targeting determinants of CR that can be modified or trained across the lifespan may lead to successful ageing by prolonging autonomous functioning and enhancing QoL.},

	abstract = {Direct reports of subjective well-being may have a useful role in the measurement of consumer preferences and social welfare, if they can be done in a credible way. Can well-being be measured by a subjective survey, even approximately? In this paper, we discuss research on how individuals' responses to subjective well-being questions vary with their circumstances and other factors. We will argue that it is fruitful to distinguish among different conceptions of utility rather than presume to measure a single, unifying concept that motivates all human choices and registers all relevant feelings and experiences. While various measures of well-being are useful for some purposes, it is important to recognize that subjective well-being measures features of individuals' perceptions of their experiences, not their utility as economists typically conceive of it. Those perceptions are a more accurate gauge of actual feelings if they are reported closer to the time of, and in direct reference to, the actual experience. We conclude by proposing the U- index, a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, and has the virtue of not requiring a cardinal conception of individuals' feelings.},
